Heart Disease Detection

This is a project for computing for health and medicine. This was a group effort by myself and 4 other teams members, we have attempted to predict heart
disease from the dataset we retrieved from Kaggle. There is everything we did in this project from the proposal ppt to the final presentation ppt and it 
also has 2 different papers which one of them explains our methodology and the other is a final report done by me to explain our findings.
